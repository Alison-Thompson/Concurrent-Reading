# Concurrent Reading

This is a project that allows teachers to do concurrent reading with their classes over zoom. 
Teachers can create a room, select readers, and highlight the text on their screen so students know what to read. Hopefully this project will help out teachers
of younger children when teaching them how to read.

Note: Herkou is rather agressive in closing websocket connections if they are inactive. If you wait to long in between doing things, it may close the connection. 

See Capture1.png for image because it doesn't want to work in the README for some reason.
